# GeoLocatable Plugin

Uses GeoPlugin.net to get Geographical location about an IP. Written to be used as part of my Loggable Plugin, to be released later...

## Usage

Finding data is the same as any other models.

To save data for an IP, do `$GeoLocatable->saveIp($ip)`, or leave `$ip` null to use current request IP.

Geo data is cached for 12 hours by default, to change this change geo_locatable/libs/settings.php
